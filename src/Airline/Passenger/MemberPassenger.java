/**
 * MemberPassenger.java is an interface which applies the State Pattern to Passenger.java which 
 * gives MemberPassenger and its implemented classes functionality of if the Passenger can register 
 * for a flight and updating the existing membership. Memberships come in Platinum, Gold, 
 * Silver, and None. MemberPassenger is a sub-interface of Serializable so we can ensure that 
 * classes which implements MemberPassenger can be serialized. This is needed since Passengers 
 * contain MemberPassenger objects and Passengers are serializable.
